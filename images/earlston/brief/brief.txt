Hi Fajarmandela,

I used you a couple of times for oh-otto, and thanks for that. They were perfect.

This time, I need a similar icon, based on glasses.

I'm writing an app for maintaining a lot of links and info from around the web, and was looking for a librarian style. This is an assistant that helps you, and the glasses indicate that looking and questing on you behalf.

It will primarily be used for a web app.

I've enclosed an image I would like copied, but it's up to you.

I don't want it in the flat icon style.

I need at least the following:
 - 16X16,
 - 32X32,
 - 64X64,

as well as the svg file.

There should be a very limited number of colors, all around Cadet Blue. Please use shades and tints from here(http://www.color-hex.com/color/5f9ea0).

There is writing on the left arm.
 - It needn't be there on smaller images, though I leave that up to you. Maybe just a line, or some shading.
 - It should be illegible, and unrecognizable as any specific script at all.


Regards


Andrew Oxenburgh
